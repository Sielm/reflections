It is usually always beneficial to have a remote, due to the risk of unexpected computer failure, but it is most useful when working on two different machines or working with other people on a single project.
It wouldn't be good if git automatically overwrites something that you are working on locally by automatically pulling something from github.
Forks copy someone elses github remote to your own github account and can be used when you want to make edits to someone else's code.  Clones are when you copy from a github remote to your own computer and is used when you want to actaully edit code from a remote repository.  Branches create branches within different code versions and is used locally to create different versions of the same code, so like an experimental and stable version.
You can then work on the most recent version of something without being online, and origin/master will be accurate offline to the most recent edits to code.
